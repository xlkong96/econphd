### Immiserizing growth in the Armington model

In week 3, we briefly introduced the Armington model with CES preferences as the simplest "Ricardian" model delivering a gravity equation.
A full introduction is presented in Section 2.1 of [Costinot and Rodriguez-Clare (Handbook, 2014)](https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-0-444-54314-1.00004-5).
We simplified their setup by assuming identical preferences, &psi; = 1 for all i,j.

For this comprehension check, please deliver response to the four queries below.
All can be shown analytically without resorting to numerical computation.

#### Free-trade equilibrium

Assume balanced budgets (Y = X) and free trade (&tau;=1 for all i,j).
The only endogenous variables are incomes.
Solve the model.
Show that the equilibrium income levels take the form Y = Q<sup>&epsilon;/(&epsilon;+1)</sup>.
What is the value of &epsilon; in this Armington model?

#### Welfare in free-trade equilibrium

A country's real income is Y/P, where P is the CES price index.
Derive an expression for real income in the free-trade equilibrium that depends only on exogenous parameters.

#### Identification

Consider an arbitrary Armington economy (rather than only the free-trade case).
Use prime to denote an alternative economy that is identical
except that country 1 has 10% lower productivity and 10% lower trade costs when exporting:
Q'<sub>1</sub> = 0.9 Q<sub>1</sub>
and
&tau;'<sub>1j</sub> = 0.9 &tau;<sub>1j</sub> &forall; j.
Compare the equilibrium outcomes of these two economies:
is country 1's share of world income higher in the prime economy?

#### Immiserizing growth

Suppose that one country experiences productivity growth (an increase in its Q).
Can a country's productivity improvement be immiserizing?
That is, can a productivity improvement reduce its real income?
Answer this question for the case of the free-trade Armington model.
See Feenstra's textbook chapter titled "Trade and Endogenous Growth" for an explanation of immiserizing growth (also see Deardorff's [glossary definition](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~alandear/glossary/i.html#ImmiserizingGrowth)).
