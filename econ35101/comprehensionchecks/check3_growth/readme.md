### Matsuyama (1992)

Combine equations (4) and (7) to produce equation (8) of Matsuyama (1992). State each mathematical step of the derivation that starts form equations (4) and (7).

### Buera and Oberfield (2020)

Re-exporting (entrep√¥t trade) is when a country exports goods that it previously imported without altering them (no value added). The estimation sample in Buera and Oberfield (2020) excludes countries in which reexports play a large role (page 104). Discuss whether re-exports and "normal" exports and the associated import flows should play similar or distinct roles in knowledge diffusion. Explain the assumptions (or evidence) underlying your answer.

Recall the Lucas (1990) paradox: "Why Does Capital Not Flow from Rich to Poor Countries?" In light of that concern, discuss the mechanism used to rationalize trade imbalances (footnote 45 of Buera and Oberfield 2020). How might counterfactual outcomes differ if trade imbalances responded otherwise?

The quantitative exercises in Buera and Oberfield (2020) hold fixed exogenous paths for countries' physical and human capital stocks (page 102). Discuss how investment in capital might respond to changes in knowledge diffusion. How would this change the quantitative-exercise results?
